            <h2>Before you start</h2>
            <p>Before you start working out there are quite a few things you'll want to know, if not need to know. If you are unaware of these things then you are likely to injure yourself or get suboptimal results. Both which can be deprimental to your motivation and will to go to the gym</p>

            <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>This is a youtube series going into detail on a lot of the aspects of training. Basically what will lead to you gaining muscle without the use of PED's. He goes into alot more detail than i am able to do in a single paragraph so i highly recomend watching atleast the first video in the series, although it is fairly long.</p>

            <h3>Posture</h3>
            <p>Another thing you wll find to be inportant is posture. As Jeff Kaplan, Athlean-x, beatifully explains in this video: If you do not have proper posture you're only creating trouble for yourself down the line. Our anatomy is set to work in a specific way. If your posture is not correct then you will force the load of certain exercises onto other parts of your body which are not meant to take that load which, in turn, will lead to injuries that will keep from exercising for atleast a couple weeks and maybe even a few years which might make you stop exercising entirely.</p>

            <h3>Technique</h3>
            <p>In addition to posture, technique is crucial for avoiding injuries and progressively overloading the correct muscles. If you try to shift the load of the weight of off the intended muscle you will at the very least lose potential stimulus on the muscle and will likely lead to long-term or even short term injuries. For example if you do not squat correctly you will force the load onto the joints in the spine and consequently develop spine-problems in the near future. Thankfully, there are people out there willing to help here. If you search for a particular exercise on youtube you will likely find a tutorial on how to do it correctly.</p>

            <h3>Injuries</h3>
            <p>Injuries are very common in the fitness world. All the way from a torn bicep to a crippled spine caused by dropping a weight on yourself. Therefore it is important to not only follow the advice I gave earlier, but also to find your own information. AKA do your own research. I am not a proffessional. This is purely a hobby of mine. If you do get hurt or if you are worried you might be developing something- Please go see a medical proffesional. Anyways, here are a few more tips to avoid gettng injured. DO NOT perform the excercise anymore if you cannot maintain proper form. DO NOT perform an exercise that is too difficult for you at this point. If you work out at the gym DO NOT load on more weight than you can handle. That's about it.</p>
