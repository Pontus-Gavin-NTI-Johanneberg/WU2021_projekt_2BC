        <h2>Influencers</h2>
        <p> Influencers can be a gold mine of knowledge or a pitfall designed to dry your wallet completely. Before I start recommending influencers just know that you should not listen to just anyone. These are businesses designed to make profits for their company. There are quite alot of shady influencers out there. If you are not sure about whether to trust them i recommend googling reviews of their products or searching/making threads on r/fitness to find out more.</p>

            <h3>Athlean-x</h3>
            <p> Athlean-x is the biggest fitness companies on youtube and one of the biggest if not the biggest on the entire internet. It's founder and face is Jeff Caveliere, a physical therapist. It is home to a plethora of usefull knowledge and tips. He is most likely the most trustworthy person you could take free advice from on youtube. I highly recommend them. One noteworthy thing though is that this channel is mainly for those who seek athleticism, not bodybuilding, powerlifting, etc. If you seek anything other than athleticism then maybe another icon will be more to your liking. Not to say that you can't still draw wisdom from his videos.

            <h3>Jeff Nippard</h3>
            <p>Continuing the trend of awesome people named Jeff is Jeff Nippard, another youtube-channel. Different from the former Jeff though, this one is dedicated to muscle-building and natural body-building. Here you will find information about what supplements to take, what your diet should look like, how to train for mass, etc. All scientifically backed by studies referenced in the videos. I also highyl recommend this channel.</p>

            <h3>V-shred</h3>
            <p> V-shred is an absolute stain on the fitness industry. Their entire business plan is marketing to the clueless masses with a prettyboy, selling them programs based on complete bogus science and selling bad supplements at outrageous prices. Do not listen to V-shred. You have been warned. Also, the link on his name leads to a high-quality video explaining why they are a terrible company much better than i am able to do in this single paragraph.</p>

            <h3>Jeremy Ethier</h3>
            <p>Jeremy Etheir is another youtuber i highyl recommend you follow. He is like the Jeff's but relies more on animations and visualisation to stand out. Like Nippard, he also references scientific studies whenever he makes an argument which makes his information very trustworthy.</p>
