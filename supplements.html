        <h2>Supplements</h2>
        <p>NOTE: The regulations on dietary supplements are very loose so do your own research on both the supplements and the seller before proceeding with purchasing them. Supplements are by definition something added to make up for a deficiency. They are an addition, not a replacement. Remember that nothing should replace a balanced diet. In this context, supplements are additions to your meal-plan. Are supplements necessary? Not for most of us. Why do people still take supplements then? It's a diverse topic with many reasonable answers however you can rest assured that not all supplements are snake oils. Some supplements can be usefull to provide a small boost to your performance and progress when training. I have shared a video that explains just which supplements are actually scientifically backed and used by proffessionals in the field.</p>

        <h3>Creatine Monohydrate</h3>
        <p>NOTE: It is only creatine monohydrate that i am reffering to. Other creatines have less promising results. Creatine is one of the most well researched supplements on the current market. It is an enzyme in your body that helps create ATP, your body's main fuel source. When taking it correctly studies show an increase of about 30% ATP production and a 5-15% boost in 1RM which is pretty damn good. Studies have also noted no ill-effects from supplementation of creatine with the longest study having been conducted for 4 years. This is most likely the best supplement to take for training purposes.</p>

        <h3>Whey Protein</h3>
        <p>Whey Protein is a protein extract from dairy products. It is a fast-acting protein that quickly gets into your bloodstream, hence why some people believe that it could be especially helpful to take after a workout. In case you aren't aware- Proteins, or rather amino acids, are the building blocks of the body. The muscle-building process is heavily reliant on protein intake. It's very cheap and can be mixed in with other things to make delicious meals. It is also one of the most researched supplements in the world.</p>

        <h3>Joint pain- and and/or injury prevention supplements</h3>
        <p>I don't actually know much about joint pain/injury prevention supplements. What I do know is that some of them are fairly scientifically backed and are proven to work in certain situations. Omega-3's are proven to also help with this to some extent but if you really care about your joints, for example if you were an athlete, then it might be worth your consideration.</p>

        <h3>Omega-3</h3>
        <p>Omega-3's a fatty acid along with Omega-6. These two are meant to keep a balance in the body but Omega-6 are crated in the body while Omega-3's are not. You find Omega 3's in fish-oil and nuts but most of us don't consume nearly enough of it. Therefore supplementing it might be a good choice.</p>

        <h3>Caffeine</h3>
        <p>Caffeine is commonly associated with feelings of being awake, and for good reason. Caffeine is one of the safest natural stimulants on the market. Athletes and bodybuilders usually supplement with it before training so they can focus as well as possible. It is worth noting though that the body gradually builds upp a resistanse towards it meaning that instead of feeling alert when you take it you feel lethargic when you don't which is why you should regularly cycle off of it.</p>
