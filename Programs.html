        <h2>Training programs</h2>
        <p>Training programs are an extremly helpful tool to help you towards your goal. Pretty much everyone who has succeded with training has made or used a training schedule with specific exercises to be done on that day. Now, what do you think is best? Entrusting your future training progress to a training programme someone else made or one you did yourself? Honestly, it is usually better to make one yourself. For beginners it is absolutely crucial that you do the exercises correctly. And for intermediate-advanced trainees it is important that the program push them to their absolute limits. However, if you have a credible source for your programme such as a proffesional training coach then it will almost always be better to entrust you training to them. Below I have picked out a bunch of credible training programs so you won't have to yourself.</p>

        <h3>Push-Pull-Legs</h3>
        <p>Push-Pull-Legs is a training template where you do Push-exercises for one day, Pull-exercises the next, Legs after that and then a reast day. Rince and repeat. As it splits your weekly muscle volume into 2 training sessions it is fairly useful. It is also very simple to set up which is why if you do make a training regime yourself as a beginner I highly recommend this format do to it's effectiveness and relative simplicity.</p>

        <h3>Bro-splits</h3>
        <p>Bro-splits is a former popular training method on which you focus your entire attention on a single muscle for a workout in an attempt to completely overload it. Sadly, most of the fitness guru's that i follow do not promote this training programme since, although it can give results, it is more dangerous due to the fatigue casuing form-breakdown. Also, most fitness guys also agree that bro-splits give worse results than other methods of training. Therefore i cannot recommend any bro-split programs even if it is not inherently useless.</p>

        <h3>Full-body</h3>
        <p>Full-body training programs is the most popular training method today as it has no limitations on what can be done each day. The fatigue that builds up in the muscles are also not a problem since you will be targeting different muscles during the workout. It is also very easy to find full-body workouts on the market. I highly recommend the ones I've chosen below and especially xero since you will be able to do it at home without needing to purchase equipment.</p>

        <h3>Upper-Lower</h3>
        <p>Upper-lower is a variation of Push-Pull-Legs where Push and Pull are pushed into the category Upper and legs are Lower. The workout schedule usually looks something like Upper-Lower-rest or Upper-Lower-Upper-rest where each upper/lower represents a day. This is a bit more complicated than PPL though so i do not recommend newbies to create one. Even more so to try it as there is too little rest for them.</p>
